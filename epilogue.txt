== Epilogue

This document has described the +abc+ program, its source code, and
its execution.

The +abc+ program is most certainly a simple program,
created as an initial test case for the Simple C/C++ Coroutines 
using Codecraft's open-source sccor library, running on 
macOS and Windows. 

There are a couple of more interesting and ambitious coroutine test programs
available as literate programs.

=== The +darts+ Program

The +darts+ program is an interactive visual test program for 
Simple C/C++ Coroutines using Codecraft's open-source sccor library.
The +darts+ program can demonstrate the simultaneous execution of 
hundreds of coroutines with elapsed times in the microseconds.

+darts+ runs in a macOS or Windows (Cygwin) Terminal window
as a command-line executable.

See <<cc-darts-program>> for the +darts+ literate program.

See <<cc-darts-mac>> for the macOS +darts+ executable that was 
tangled and compiled from the +darts+ literate program.

See <<cc-darts-win>> for the Windows (Cygwin) +darts+ executable that was 
tangled and compiled from the +darts+ literate program.

=== The +elevator+ Program

The +elevator+ program is a visual and interactive test program that 
simulates a bank of elevators.
It too is a Simple C/C++ Coroutines test program, one which provides
a more extensive demonstration of the coroutines' capabilities and
performance.

+elevator+ runs in a macOS or Windows (Cygwin) Terminal window
as a command-line executable.

See <<cc-elevator-program>> for the +elevator+ literate program.

See <<cc-elevator-mac>> for the macOS +elevator+ executable that was 
tangled and compiled from the +elevator+ literate program.

See <<cc-elevator-win>> for the Windows (Cygwin) +elevator+ 
executable that was tangled and compiled from the +elevator+ 
literate program.

=== The sccor Library

I hope to have piqued your interest in the multi-platform 
Simple C/C++ Coroutines available with Codecraft's open-source sccor library.

The sccor library is currently available in macOS and Windows 
(Cygwin) versions.

See <<cc-sccor-mac>> for the macOS version.

See <<cc-sccor-win>> for the Windows (Cygwin) version.
