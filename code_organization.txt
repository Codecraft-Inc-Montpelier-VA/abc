== Code Layout

In literate programming terminology,
a _chunk_ is a named part of the final program.
The program chunks form a tree and the root of that tree
is named '\*' by default.
We follow the convention of naming the root the same as the output
file name.
There is just a single root in this literate program, 
the +abc.cpp+ file.
The process of extracting the program tree formed by the chunks is
called _tangle_.
The program, +atangle+, extracts each root chunk to produce
the corresponding C/C++ source file.
